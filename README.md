# Search Vocab

This Chrome Extension lets you translate vocabulary into your target language.
The translated word fetches Wikipedia articles that might be interesting to you.

To build the extension run:
```
npm run build
```

Then go to Chrome Browser/ Extensions and enable Developer Mode. After that go to "load unpacked" and pick the build folder that was created from the extension. You should now see the extension box in your installed extensions.
